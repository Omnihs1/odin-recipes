<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>It's officially happy hour with these easy strawberry daiquiris 
made with either frozen or fresh, sweet, in-season strawberries 
if you can find them. A little citrus juice 
really kicks the strawberry 
flavor up a notch and
a bit of lemon-lime soda adds a hint of effervescence. Double or triple this 
recipe for a party and you'll never buy daiquiri mixes or canned, 
ready-made daiquiris again. 
Leave out the rum for a batch of the best strawberry-citrus mocktails around!</p>
